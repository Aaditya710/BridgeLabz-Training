📅 Day 10 – Java OOPS: Constructors & Class-Level Concepts
(Date: 27-Dec-2025) (Focus: Constructors, Instance Variables vs Class Variables & Methods)

Learned the concept of Constructors in Java and understood their role in initializing objects.
Practiced creating default and parameterized constructors to assign initial values to objects.
Practiced creating classes with variables and methods, and instantiating multiple objects.
Understood the difference between instance variables (object-specific data) and class-level (static) variables (shared data).
Implemented programs to observe how static variables maintain a common state across multiple objects.
Learned the distinction between instance methods and class (static) methods, and when to use each.
Gained clarity on accessing instance members using objects and class members using the class name.
Focused on writing clean, readable, and well-structured OOPS-based code.
